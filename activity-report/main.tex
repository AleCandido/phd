\title{Research Activity Report}
\author{Alessandro Candido}

\abstract{
    Following, the activity report about the research performed in the period
    October 2019 - September 2022, as a member of the \nnnpdf{} team, and
    lately also of the \nnpdf{} collaboration, under the supervision of the
    prof. Stefano Forte.
    Most of the research has been focused on the development of a new
    framework, to provide fast, flexible, and reproducible theory predictions
    for \pdf{} fitting.
    Despite this being the main effort, a number of other results has been
    achieved in the meanwhile, from framework's applications, to dedicated
    studies.
    Attendance to schools and conferences is reported at the end, together with
    references to delivered talks.
