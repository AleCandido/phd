- [x] pag. 14, eqs. (1.14),(1.15): FL and x F3 are defined/motivated in sec.
  1.1.3 below; EC, NC and CC are explained in sec. 1.1.2. I would modify the
  order of these sections.
- [x] pag. 16, pag. 17, pag. 22, pag. 23: it seems that the definition of
  “heavyness” (“light”, “heavy”, etc.) depends on the context e.g. whether we
  are considering structure functions or coefficient functions, which flavour
  number scheme are we adopting. However, as presented in the current way, I
  find it confusing. I would explain in a single paragraph the usage of the word
  e.g. “light” in the different contexts. Or I would keep the presentation as it
  is, but I would add more comments and references to the other sections.
- [x] pag. 30: I would point out that N3LO corrections to the splitting kernels
  are only known in an approximate form.
- [x] pag. 30: “in the determination of the matrix elements for several
  processes” → “in the determination of the short-distance cross sections for
  several processes”
- [ ] pag. 43, Fig. 2.6 and pag. 46, Fig. 2.10: on the plot on the right, I
  would explicitly label the curves with μth = m2 b /2 and μth = 2m2 b , for
  sake of clarity.
  > unfortunately, not possible in the short term...
- [x] pag. 51: “Producing only operators makes EKO less competitive for single
  one-shot applications, but the optimal scaling with the size of the task
  (practically constant, since the time consumed is dominated by the operator
  calculation) makes it extremely good for massive evolution (and already good
  when evolving O(10) elements).”: I would explicitly show an example of
  benchmark for such a massive evolution (as far as I have understood, the
  benchmarks shown in the previous sections are all for the evolution of a
  single PDF).
- [ ] pag. 62: “There are two categories of possible approaches”: it is not
  clear which are the first and the second categories.
- [ ] pag. 62: “ It is not possible to reconstruct from the exact value of an
  observable from this information: many missing terms do not belong to the same
  class of known ones, since it is possible to group terms in such a way that
  Callan-Symanzik equations are respected for each group, but only the sum of
  all groups value is the value of the full series”. I don’t understand the
  meaning of this sentence.
- [ ] pag. 70: “More precisely, only the kind of scales to be varied are two,
  but there is one renormalization scale associated to each process, so the
  amount of scales is essentially p + 1, where p is the amount of processes in
  the dataset.”. I am not sure I understand this sentence. What is the nature of
  these p + 1 scales i.e. are they ren. or fac. scales? If p ren. scales and 1
  fac. scales, why only 1 fac. scale? Since this assumption is crucial for the
  rest of the discussion, I would explain it better.
- [x] pag. 83: “Moreover, eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) itself does not coincide with the
  correct and general eqs. (4.1) and (4.2), because eq. (4.2) ...”: probably
  wrong references.

- [ ] pag. 133, Fig. 6.9: I would increase the size of the plots.
- [x] pag. 154: in a few places, a space after MS is required.

I further have some typographical suggestions:
- [ ] some words are in boldface without a clear reason (e.g. “theory
  predictions” at pag. 55). I would remove the boldface characters or use them
  in a more systematic way.
- [x] before each keyword, there is a larger space. I would suggest to uniform
  the spaces through-out the document.
