## Chapter 0
- [x] At the bottom of page 3, in the first description of deep-inelastic scattering,
  the reason why is called inelastic is missing.

## Chapter 1
- [x] Page 13 there’s a compile mistake :math:F3:
- [x] When discussing heavy flavours in section 1.3 the adjective “active” is
  used with two different meaning: the standard one, i.e., the number of light
  flavours that take part in the evolution and a non-standard one, as the heavy
  flavour which as non-zero electro-weak couplings. The terminology should be
  clarified because it is confusing.

## Chapter 2
- [x] In section 2.1 the Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions are presented as
  functions of two scales. Although the meaning is clear, I would suggest adding
  a sentence to explain this, because it is not the standard way of presenting
  them. Also, at the top of page 32: “expose”-> “admit”.
- [x] At the very end of the chapter there is some spurious text that should be
  removed.

## Chapter 3
- [x] In section 3.1, there is a brief description of DGLAP evolution and EKO.
  These topics are presented as if they were mentioned for the first time, while
  they were discussed at length in chapter 2. I would suggest rewording this
  paragraph.

## Chapter 4
- [x] The second paragraph on page 61 must be corrected because it refers to
  something discussed at the beginning of the chapter... while this is the very
  beginning of the chapter
- [x] I find the final paragraph on page 61 difficult to read: “two orders,
  etc”. On page 62, second paragraph of section 4.1, I do not understand what is
  meant by “consumed”.
- [x] On page 64, the second and third paragraphs of section 4.2 are hard to
  read. Also, I do not understand the meaning of the sentence “by appointing the
  distribution...”
- [ ] On page 68, I think that a few equations describing the schemes A, B and C
  could be helpful.
  > many objects need to be defined to write down the equations, that are
  > definitely not straightforward, so they are omitted in favor of the
  > reference to the exact section in the original paper
- [ ] I do not have specific suggestions, but I do find section 4.4. difficult
  to follow, although well-detailed.

## Chapter 5
- [x] This chapter closely follows the Nature publication and its supplemental
  material. Thus, the text is clear, although in a couple of instances it should
  have been better adapted to the thesis format, e.g., on page 98 one can find
  the expression “in the main manuscript”, clearly referring to the publication.
  The same comment holds for the section “Summary” on page 117.
- [ ] I would ask a clarification about the 3-sigma evidence. The text at the
  beginning of the chapter, on page 87, seems to suggest that the 3-sigma
  evidence is supported by recent data on Z+c by the LHCb collaboration, while
  on page 93 it is said that 3-sigma is obtained by adding either the LHCb or
  the EMC data, neither of which is present in the standard dataset
  > there should have been a misunderstanding: this part is adherent to the
  > original publication, and it is said that the 3-sigma evidence is confirmed
  > with the addition of the two datasets, but it is clearly present also
  > without them

## Chapter 6
- [ ] I have no specific comment on this chapter, other than the same one
  mentioned for chapter 5, i.e., the adaptation from paper-format to thesis-
  format, if required.

## Chapter 7
- [x] On page 154, there are two instances of missing space between the MSbar
  symbol and the following word.
- [ ] In Eq. (7.10) and following, e.g., (7.14), the coefficient function in
  MSbar is defined by subtracting the pole, the usual constant but also the
  logarithmic Q2 /μ 2 dependence. I would say that the standard procedure is to
  use counterterms that do not depend on the scale, so that the scale dependence
  is left in the coefficient function. This is clearly equivalent, but perhaps
  it is worth commenting on it.

## Chapter 8
- [x] I do not have any specific comment for this chapter.
