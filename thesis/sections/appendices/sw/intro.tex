Software has been central in \acrlong{hep} since many years

\hep needs and deserves reliable and maintainable software, i.e.\ not dead or
frozen, but living and evolving according to the needs of the field.

There is limited manpower available to write software.
Therefore, this has to be compensate by good designs and architectures, and to
do that is appropriate concert development planning with all the relevant
stakeholders.
