In this appendix we compare partonic luminosities
and \lhc differential distributions obtained with \nnpdfr{4.0} in
Sects.~\ref{sec:largexpdfs}
and~\ref{sec:afb} with those based 
on its predecessor
NNPDF3.1, as well as with a variant of \nnpdfr{4.0}
where positivity is imposed at the level of observable cross-sections but
not at the \pdf level, as was the case in  NNPDF3.1, which we will denote
\nnpdfr{4.0}(3.1pos).

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfplot-absDYlumis-pdfsets-plus-q5tev-nnpdf31}
compares the 
symmetric partonic luminosities $\mathcal{L}_{S,q}$
evaluated for $\mll=5$~TeV.
%
The three sets are found to agree within uncertainties,
with \nnpdfr{4.0} having the smallest uncertainties.
%
This increase in precision
arises only marginally due to the more restrictive positivity constraints,
since predictions with the \nnpdfr{4.0}(3.1pos) variant 
are close to the baseline \nnpdfr{4.0}, especially 
for the $u\bar{u}$ contribution, for both central values and uncertainties.
%
The comparison in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfplot-absDYlumis-pdfsets-plus-q5tev-nnpdf31}
indicates that phenomenological predictions for high-mass Drell-Yan
production based on NNPDF3.1 are expected
to be consistent within errors with those of \nnpdfr{4.0} for the contributions
symmetric in $\cos\theta^*$, such as the $|\yll|$ distribution.

The antisymmetric luminosities $\mathcal{L}_{A,q}$, relevant for the
forward-backward asymmetry, are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfplot-absDYlumis-pdfsets-minus-q5tev-nnpdf31}
for $\mll = 3$ and 5 TeV respectively.
%
Their qualitative behavior is similar for all  \pdf sets,
with a marked decrease of \pdf uncertainties first from NNPDF3.1
to  \nnpdfr{4.0}(3.1pos)  then
to \nnpdfr{4.0}.
%
Specifically, the qualitative $\mll$ dependence
of $\mathcal{L}_{A,q}$ remains unchanged. Namely, the positive $A_{\rm fb}$
found for $\mll= 3$ TeV decreases 
as the dilepton invariant mass is increased.
%
Hence also for the component of the Drell-Yan cross-section which is odd
in $\cos\theta^*$ we expect \lhc predictions based on NNPDF3.1 to be consistent
with those obtained from \nnpdfr{4.0}.

These expectations are confirmed by
Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_COSTH_5000_YLL40-vs-31}, which shows the
dilepton rapidity $|y_{\ell\bar{\ell}}|$ 
and the Collins-Soper angle $\cos\theta^*$ distributions for neutral-current DY production
at the \lhc 14 TeV for dilepton invariant masses of $m_{\ell\bar{\ell}}\ge 5$ TeV,
comparing the baseline \nnpdfr{4.0} predictions with those from NNPDF3.1
and \nnpdfr{4.0}(3.1pos).
%
Indeed, 
good agreement within the three \pdf sets is observed with a significant reduction
of \pdf uncertainties between NNPDF3.1 and \nnpdfr{4.0}, consistent
with the behaviour exhibited by the corresponding partonic luminosities.
