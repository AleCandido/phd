The aim of this  section is to scrutinize the PDF dependence of the
neutral-current \acrlong{dy} differential cross-section and of the associated
forward-backward asymmetry by reviewing the \lo kinematics, determining \lo
analytic expressions, and finally comparing these analytical calculations to
the results of \lo and \nlo  numerical simulations obtained using \mgamc,
\cite{Alwall:2014hca}, interfaced to \pineappl,
\cite{Carrazza:2020gss,christopher_schwan_2022_7023438}.
%
Specifically, we will relate the behavior of the differential distribution and
asymmetry to the relevant parton luminosities.

\subsection{Drell-Yan kinematics and cross-sections at \lo}
\label{sec:dylo}

We consider dilepton production via the exchange of an electroweak neutral
gauge boson $Z/\gamma^*$ in proton-proton collisions:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:DYprocess}
  \mathrm{p}(k_1) + \mathrm{p}(k_2) \to Z/\gamma^*(q) \to \ell(p_{\ell}) + \bar{\ell}(p_{\bar{\ell}}) + X \text{.}
\end{equation}
The hadronic differential cross-section $\dd\sigma^{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\llb}$  is factorized in
terms of PDFs $f_i$ and the partonic cross sections
$\dd\hat\sigma_{ij}$ for incoming partons of species $i,\,j$ as
\begin{equation}
  \dd\sigma^{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\llb} = \sum_{ij} \int\limits_0^1\!\dd x_1 \dd
  x_2 f_i(x_1,\mu_F^2) f_j(x_2,\mu_F^2) \dd\hat\sigma_{ij}(\hat k_1 = x_1
  k_1, \hat k_2 = x_2 k_2).
  \label{eq:factorization}
\end{equation}
In the sequel we will set the  factorization scale $\mu_F$ to the
invariant mass of the gauge boson, i.e.\ the dilepton
invariant mass, so $\mu^2_F = \mll^2=(p_\ell + p_{\bar{\ell}})^2$.
%
The kinematics and Feynman diagram of the \lo partonic process
in the quark-antiquark channel are shown in \cref{fig:lo-dy}.
We do not consider photon-initiated processes, as they do not affect
the qualitative features of our discussion.

At \lo, the momentum fractions of the two incoming partons are fully
fixed by knowledge of the invariant mass and rapidity of the gauge
boson, i.e.\ of the dilepton pair  $\yll = (y_\ell + y_{\bar{\ell}})/2$: 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:x_fractions}
  x_1 = \frac{ \mll}{\sqrt{s}}\exp(\yll) \, ,\quad x_2 = \frac{
  \mll}{\sqrt{s}}\exp(-\yll) \, ,
\end{equation}
where the center of mass energy of the hadronic collision is
$s=(k_1+k_2)^2$ and at \lo
$\mll^2 = \hat s = x_1 x_2 s$. The absolute dilepton
rapidity thus lies in the range $|\yll|\le \ln (\sqrt{s}/\mll)$.
Beyond \lo there might be extra radiation in the final state, so the \lo
kinematics provides a lower bound on the momentum fractions of the
incoming partons, and all values of the momentum
fractions such that $x_{1,2}\ge \mll/\sqrt s$ are allowed.

It is useful to define the so-called  Collins-Soper
angle $\theta^*$~\cite{Collins:1977iv}, which in the hadronic \acrfull{com}
frame is defined as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \cos\theta^* &= \sign (\yll) \cos\theta \, ,\\
  \cos\theta &\equiv\frac{p_\ell^+ p_{\bar{\ell}}^- - p_\ell^- p_{\bar{\ell}}^+}{\mll \sqrt{\mll^2 + p_{\mathrm{T},\ell\bar{\ell}}^2}} \text{,} \quad p^\pm = p^0 \pm p^3 \text{.}
  \label{eq:cosine-cs-angle}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
It is easy to show that the Collins-Soper angle $\theta^*$ coincides with the
scattering angle of the lepton in the partonic \com frame, $\bar\theta$.
%
The latter is defined in terms of the lepton momentum as 
\begin{equation}
 \cos\bar\theta \equiv \frac{p^z_\ell}{\mll} \,, \label{eq:coscm}
\end{equation}
where the $z$ axis is along the direction of the incoming quark-antiquark pair.
%
In the partonic \com frame, of course, $p^z_\ell=-p^z_{\bar \ell}$ and $\yll
=0$, so
\begin{equation}
p^\pm_\ell=p^{\mp}_{\bar{\ell}}=  \mll \left( 1\pm \cos{\bar\theta} \right)\, ,
\end{equation}
and substituting in \cref{eq:cosine-cs-angle} it immediately follows that,
taking the convention 
$\sign (\yll)=\sign(0)=+1$, 
$\cos\theta^*=\cos\theta=\cos{\bar\theta}$.
%
The expression of $\cos\theta$ in \cref{eq:cosine-cs-angle} is manifestly
invariant upon boosts along the $z$ axis, so the identification of $\theta$
with the \com scattering angle $\bar\theta$ remains true in any reference
frame.

Note that the definition \cref{eq:coscm} requires a choice for the positive
direction of the $z$ axis, which is usually taken along the direction of the
incoming fermion (quark).
%
This direction is  not experimentally accessible in proton-proton collisions,
so the Collins-Soper angle is defined by always taking the positive $z$ axis in
the direction of the boosted dilepton pair, i.e., at \lo, along the direction of
the incoming quark with largest momentum fraction, i.e.\ by supplementing in
the definition a factor $\sign(\yll)$.
%
Hence $\cos\theta^*=\cos{\bar\theta}$ ($\cos\theta^*=-\cos{\bar\theta}$)  if
the momentum fraction of the incoming quark (antiquark) is the largest.

%
The hard scattering matrix elements that enter the partonic cross-section
in \cref{eq:factorization} are the sum of a pure photon-exchange
contribution, a photon-$Z$ interference term, and a pure $Z$-exchange
contribution.
%
Of course, in the region
$\mll \gtrsim m_Z$ these contributions are all of the same order.
%
Standard arguments~\cite{Peskin:1995ev} then imply that, because in the
Standard Model the photon
coupling to leptons is vector  while the $Z$ coupling is chiral,
the pure photon and pure $Z$ contributions to the cross-section are
necessarily  even in $\cos\theta^*$ while the interference term is
odd.

Specifically, at \lo the fully differential hadronic cross-section can
be obtained from the well-known result~\cite{Peskin:1995ev} for
$e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-$ by replacing the incoming lepton charges  with
those of the quarks, and accounting for the PDFs, with
the result
\begin{align}
    \frac{\dd^3 \sigma}{\dd \mll \, \dd \yll \, \dd\cos\theta^*} &= \frac{\pi \alpha^2}{3 \mll s} \left((1+\cos^2({\theta^*})) \sum_q S_q \left[f_q(x_1,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_2,\mll^2) + f_q(x_2,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_1,\mll^2) \right] \right. \nonumber\\
    &\hspace*{15pt} + \left. \cos\theta^* \sum_q A_q \sign (\yll) \left[ f_q(x_1,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_2,\mll^2) - f_q(x_2,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_1,\mll^2)\right] \right) \, ,
    \label{eq:lo-triple-diff}
\end{align}
where  $\alpha$ is the QED coupling and the even (symmetric) and
odd  (antisymmetric) couplings are given by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:coup}
    S_q &= e_l^2 e_q^2 + P_{\gamma Z} \cdot  e_l v_l e_q v_q + P_{ZZ} \cdot  (v_l^2+a_l^2)(v_q^2+a_q^2) \nonumber \\
    A_q &= P_{\gamma Z} \cdot 2 e_l a_l e_q a_q  + P_{ZZ} \cdot 8 v_l a_l  v_q a_q \, ,
\end{align}
in terms of the electric charges  $e_l$, $e_q$ and the vector and
axial couplings $v_l$, $v_q$ and $a_l$, $a_q$  of the leptons and
quarks, and the propagator factors
\begin{align}\label{eq:propgz}
    P_{\gamma Z}(\mll) &= \frac{2\mll^2 (\mll^2  - m_Z^2)}{\sin^2(\theta_W) \cos^2(\theta_W)\left[(\mll^2 - m_Z^2)^2 + \Gamma_Z^2 m_Z^2\right]}\\
\label{eq:propzz}
    P_{ZZ}(\mll) &= \frac{\mll^4}{\sin^4(\theta_W) \cos^4(\theta_W)\left[(\mll^2 - m_Z^2)^2 + \Gamma_Z^2 m_Z^2\right]},
\end{align}
with $m_Z$  and $\Gamma_Z$ respectively the $Z$ mass and width and $\theta_W$ the weak mixing angle.
%
In \cref{fig:lo-couplings} we display the
symmetric $S_q$ (left) and antisymmetric $A_q$ (right)
couplings, \cref{eq:coup}, for up-like and
down-like quarks, as a function of 
the dilepton invariant mass $\mll$.
%
Both couplings are around a factor 2 larger for
up-like quarks than for down-like quarks, and
become $\mll$-independent for $\mll \gsim 1$ TeV, where they take
the asymptotic values $\bar S_q$, $\bar A_q$ obtained by
substituting in \cref{eq:coup} the large-mass expressions of
the propagator factors
\begin{equation}\label{eq:propasympt}
    \bar P_{\gamma Z} = \frac{2}{\sin^2(\theta_W)\cos^2(\theta_W)},
    \qquad 
    \bar P_{ZZ} = \frac{1}{\sin^4(\theta_W) \cos^4(\theta_W)},
\end{equation}
to which $P_{\gamma Z}$ and $P_{ZZ}$ respectively reduce up to $O(m^2_Z/\mll^2)$ corrections.

The interference term proportional to
$A_q$ is odd in the Collins-Soper angle $\cos\theta^*$, leading to a forward-backward
scattering asymmetry.
%
In a proton-proton collision the initial state is completely
symmetric, so the quark and antiquark contributions to the
cross-section \cref{eq:lo-triple-diff} are necessarily symmetric
upon the interchange of the incoming quark and antiquark, with the
corresponding momentum fractions fixed at \lo by
\cref{eq:x_fractions}.
%
However, as mentioned, there
is a sign change in the relation between $\cos\theta^*$ and
$\cos\theta$ according to whether the incoming parton with largest
momentum fraction is a quark or an antiquark, i.e.,
when interchanging
$x_1$ with $x_2$ in the argument of the quark and antiquark PDFs,
thereby leading to the result of  \cref{eq:lo-triple-diff}.
%
This leads
to a forward-backward asymmetry whenever the quark and antiquark
PDFs have different $x$ dependence.

In order to understand the relation of this forward-backward
asymmetry in terms of the
behavior of the PDFs, it is convenient
to rewrite the PDF combinations that contribute to the differential
cross-section \cref{eq:lo-triple-diff} in terms of symmetric and
antisymmetric parton luminosities, defined as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}_{S,q}(\mll, \yll) &\equiv f_q(x_1,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_2,\mll^2) + f_q(x_2,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_1,\mll^2) \, ,
  \nonumber\\
  \mathcal{L}_{A,q}(\mll, \yll) &\equiv \sign (\yll) \left[ f_q(x_1,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_2,\mll^2) - f_q(x_2,\mll^2) f_{\bar{q}}(x_1,\mll^2)\right] \, , \label{eq:symm_asymm_lumis}
\end{align}
where the momentum fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$ are given in terms of $\mll$, $\yll$,
and $\sqrt{s}$ in \cref{eq:x_fractions}.
Note that both parton luminosities are invariant under
the interchange $x_1\leftrightarrow x_2$, upon which $\yll \to -\yll$.
%
In terms of these luminosities, the triple differential cross-section \cref{eq:lo-triple-diff}
takes the compact form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lo-triple-diff-lumis}
  \frac{\dd^3 \sigma}{\dd \mll \, \dd \yll \, \dd\cos\theta^*} =
  \frac{\pi \alpha^2}{3 \mll s} \left( (1+\cos^2({\theta^*})) \sum_q S_q \mathcal{L}_{S,q}(\mll, \yll)
  + \cos\theta^* \sum_q A_q \mathcal{L}_{A,q}(\mll, \yll)  \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
which explicitly displays
its symmetry properties upon the transformation $\cos\theta^* \to -\cos\theta^*$,
equivalent to a charge conjugation transformation 
$q\leftrightarrow \bar q$ and $\ell \leftrightarrow \bar{\ell} $.

The symmetric and antisymmetric parton luminosities \cref{eq:symm_asymm_lumis} can also be expressed
in terms of the sum and difference of quark and antiquark PDFs,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fqpm}
  f_{q}^\pm \left( x, Q\right) = f_{q} \left( x, Q\right) \pm f_{\bar{q}} \left( x, Q\right) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $f_{q}^-$ is usually called the valence PDF combination,
and $f_{q}^+$  the total quark PDF\@. Note that at \lo, and more
generally in factorization schemes in which PDFs are
positive, such as $\msbar$ \cite{Candido:2020yat}, $f^+_q$
is positive while $f_q^-$
in general is not, and $f_{q}^+>|f_{q}^-|$.
%
We can write the symmetric and antisymmetric parton luminosities in
\cref{eq:symm_asymm_lumis} as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}_{S,q}(\mll, \yll) &= \frac {1} 2 \left( f_q^+(x_1,\mll^2) f_{q}^+(x_2,\mll^2) - f_q^-(x_2,\mll^2) f_{q}^-(x_1,\mll^2)  \right) \, \label{eq:lumiss_qpm}\\
  \mathcal{L}_{A,q}(\mll, \yll) &= \frac {\sign (\yll)} 2 \left( f_q^-(x_1,\mll^2) f_{q}^+(x_2,\mll^2) - f_q^-(x_2,\mll^2) f_{q}^+(x_1,\mll^2)  \, \right) \,. \label{eq:lumisa_qpm}
\end{align}

The symmetric luminosity $\mathcal{L}_{S,q}$ is of course positive,
and it is
dominated by the $f_q^+(x_1,\mll^2) f_{q}^+(x_2,\mll^2)$ term, which
is always larger than the valence contribution 
$f_q^-(x_2,\mll^2) f_{q}^-(x_1,\mll^2)$.
The sign of the antisymmetric combination, that in turn
drives the sign of the
forward-backward asymmetry, is in general not determined
uniquely.
%
If $x_1$ is in the region of the valence peak, and $x_2$ in
the small $x$ region, then $f^-(x_1,\mll^2)\gg f^-(x_2,\mll^2)$, and the
antisymmetric luminosity is positive provided only that the valence PDF is positive.
%
As we will discuss in Sect.~\ref{sec:largexpdfs},
while this is indeed the case in
the $Z$-peak region, it is actually not necessarily the case in the
high dilepton mass region relevant for BSM searches.

\subsection{Single-differential distributions and the forward-backward asymmetry}
\label{sec:numlo}
Starting from the triple differential cross section,
\cref{eq:lo-triple-diff-lumis}, one can define 
single differential distributions by integrating the other two kinematic variables
over the available phase space.
%
In particular, the single-differential distribution in the
Collins-Soper angle $\theta^*$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dsigma-dcos}
  \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\cos\theta^*} = \int\limits_{\mll^{\text{min}}}^{\sqrt s}\!\dd\mll\!\!\int\limits_{\ln(\mll/\sqrt s)}^{\ln(\sqrt s/\mll)}\!\!\dd\yll\, \frac{\dd^3 \sigma}{\dd \mll \, \dd \yll \, \dd\cos\theta^*} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\mll^{\text{min}}$ is a lower kinematic cut in the dilepton invariant mass.
%
Since \cref{eq:lo-triple-diff-lumis} falls off steeply with $\mll$, the region
with $\mll \gsim \mll^{\text{min}}$ will dominate the integral.
%
Given that the dependence of the fully differential cross-section
\cref{eq:lo-triple-diff-lumis}
on  the Collins-Soper angle factorizes with respect to the PDF
dependence, the integration over rapidity and invariant mass does not
affect the  $\cos\theta^*$ dependence, and the single-differential
cross section \cref{eq:dsigma-dcos} takes the simple form 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dsigma-dcos-v2}
  \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\cos\theta^*} = (1+\cos^2\theta^*)\sum_q g_{S,q} + \cos\theta^*\sum_q g_{A,q} \, ,
\end{equation}
where the symmetric and antisymmetric coefficients $g_{S,q}$ and $g_{A,q}$ depend on the quark flavor
and on the invariant mass cut $\mll^{\text{min}}$, but not on the
Collins-Soper angle itself.
%
The contributions relevant for the forward-backward asymmetry, $g_{A,q}$,
are given at \lo by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gAq_integrated_1}
g_{A,q} =\frac{\pi \alpha^2}{3 s} \int\limits_{\mll^{\text{min}}}^{\sqrt s}\frac{\dd\mll}{\mll}A_{q}(\mll)\!\!\int\limits_{\ln(\mll/\sqrt s)}^{\ln(\sqrt s/\mll)}\!\!\dd\yll\, \mathcal{L}_{A,q}(\mll,\yll) \, ,
\end{equation}
which in the large-$\mll$ region,
 expressing the longitudinal momentum integration in terms of
$x_1$ (assuming $x_1~\ge x_2$), becomes
\begin{equation}
  g_{A,q} = \frac{\pi \alpha^2\bar A_q}{3 s} \int\limits_{\mll^{\text{min}}}^{\sqrt s}\frac{\dd\mll}{\mll}
  \!\!\int\limits_{\mll/\sqrt s}^{1}\!\!\frac{\text{d}x_1}{x_1}\, 
  \mathcal{L}_{A,q}(\mll,x_1)+\mathcal{O} \left(\frac{m_Z^2}{\mll^2}\right) \, ,
  \label{eq:gAq_integrated}
\end{equation}
where the $\mll$-independent effective couplings $\bar A_q$  are
given substituting in \cref{eq:coup} the expressions for
the asymptotic propagator factors \cref{eq:propasympt}.

Upon integration over the Collins-Soper angle, the
antisymmetric contribution vanishes: so for instance the
rapidity distribution
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dsigma-dyll}
  \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\yll} = \int\limits_{\mll^{\text{min}}}^{\sqrt s}\!\dd\mll \int\limits_{-1}^{1}\!\!\dd\cos\theta^*\, \frac{\dd^3 \sigma}{\dd \mll \, \dd \yll \, \dd\cos\theta^*} \, ,
\end{equation}
does not depend on terms proportional to $A_q$.
%
Hence, for BSM searches in which one is
interested in the interference terms, as well as for PDF studies in which one is
interested in the valence-sea separation, the forward-backward
asymmetry is especially relevant.
%
This observable is
defined at the differential level as
\begin{equation}
  A_{\text{fb}}(\cos\theta^*) \equiv \frac{ \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\cos\theta^*}(\cos\theta^*)
  - \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\cos\theta^*}(-\cos\theta^*)}{ \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\cos\theta^*}(\cos\theta^*)
  + \frac{\dd\sigma}{\dd\cos\theta^*}(-\cos\theta^*) } \, ,\quad \cos\theta^*>0 \, ,
  \label{eq:forward-backward-asymmetry}
\end{equation}
which in terms of the coefficients introduced in
\cref{eq:dsigma-dcos-v2} is given at \lo by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:afb_lo}
  A_{\text{fb}}(\cos\theta^*)   = \frac{\cos\theta^*}{(1+\cos^2(\theta^*))}\frac{\sum_q g_{A,q} }{\sum_{q'} g_{S,q'}} \, ,\quad \cos\theta^*>0 \,.
\end{equation}
This  shows that the dependence on $\cos\theta^*$ factorizes
and the PDF dependence only appears as an overall normalization factor
depending on the ratio of $\sum_q g_{A,q}$
and $\sum_q g_{S,q}$, which in turn depend on the antisymmetric and symmetric
partonic luminosities $ \mathcal{L}_{A,q}$ and $ \mathcal{L}_{S,q}$ respectively.
%
Note that the overall sign of $A_{\text{fb}}$ remains in general undetermined.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to illustrate concretely these results,  
in \cref{fig:lo-diff-cos} we display the
single-inclusive differential distribution in $\cos\theta^*$,
\cref{eq:dsigma-dcos},
and the corresponding forward-backward asymmetry,
\cref{eq:forward-backward-asymmetry} evaluated at \lo
for $\mll^{\text{min}}=\SI{5}{\TeV}$. The single-differential rapidity
distribution \cref{eq:dsigma-dyll}) is also shown for reference in Fig.~\ref{fig:lo-diff-yll}.
%
We display both a numerical evaluation based on \mgamc interfaced to \pineappl,
as well as analytic results found using the form \cref{eq:lo-triple-diff-lumis}
of the triple differential luminosity, with all the values of the parameters
entering \crefrange{eq:coup}{eq:propzz} set to the values used in the \mgamc
runcard, and performing  numerically the integrals in
\cref{eq:dsigma-dcos,eq:dsigma-dyll}.
%
For validation purposes, no kinematic cuts are applied to the rapidities and
transverse momenta of final-state leptons.
The \pdf input is taken to be given, for illustrative purposes, by one of the
replicas of the \nnpdfr{4.0} \nnlo set.
The relative difference between the analytic and numerical calculation is shown
in the bottom panels of \cref{fig:lo-diff-cos} and demonstrates perfect
agreement. 

While the discussion so far has been presented  at \lo, its qualitative
features are unaffected by  higher-order corrections.
%
To illustrate this, in \cref{fig:lo-kfact} we compare the \lo result  from
\cref{fig:lo-diff-cos} to the corresponding \nlo \qcd result.
%
The bottom panels display the \nlo $K$-factor for the $\cos\theta^*$
distribution and the forward-backward asymmetry.
%
Whereas the \nlo $K$-factor in the $\cos\theta^*$ distribution is quite large
(around 40\%) it exhibits only a mild dependence on the Collins-Soper angle.
%
For $A_{\text{fb}}$, the $K$-factor is at the 10\% level and essentially
independent of the value of $\cos\theta^*$.
