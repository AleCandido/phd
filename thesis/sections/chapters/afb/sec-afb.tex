After the qualitative discussion of the previous sections, here we
present results for the $\cos\theta^*$
distributions Eq.~(\ref{eq:dsigma-dcos}) and the
forward-backward asymmetry Eq.~(\ref{eq:forward-backward-asymmetry}), with
\nlo QCD and electroweak corrections included and
with realistic selection and acceptance cuts for the LHC at $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV
and different values of the invariant mass $\mll$ relevant for SM
studies and BSM searches.

Computations are performed using \mgamc~\cite{Alwall:2014hca},
interfaced to \pineappl~\cite{Carrazza:2020gss,christopher_schwan_2022_7023438} to generate
fast interpolation grids.
%
In order to account for realistic detector acceptances,
we impose phase-space cuts on the transverse momentum and the pseudo-rapidity of the two
leading leptons,
\be
p_T^{\ell} > 10~{\rm GeV}  \, ,\qquad |\eta_{\ell}| < 2.4 \,.
\ee
We then consider various regions of dilepton invariant mass $\mll$:
either close to the $Z$-boson peak ($60$~GeV $< \mll < 120$~GeV),
relevant for precision SM studies, or the
high-mass region relevant for BSM searches, with  various choices of a
lower mass invariant cutoff ($\mll > 3,4,5,6$~TeV).
%
In all cases, in order to facilitate the interpretation of
hadron-level results  and the connection to
the discussion of the PDF features from Sect.~\ref{sec:largexpdfs},
we also provide results for the two partonic channels that give the
largest contribution to the cross-section.
%
As in Sect.~\ref{sec:largexpdfs}, we compare results obtained using
the  ABMP16, CT18, MSHT20, and \nnpdfr{4.0} PDF sets.
%
In all cases, we
use the  \nnlo sets corresponding to the value $\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.118$
of the strong coupling.
%
Results obtained using the NNPDF3.1 PDF set are reported in App.~\ref{app:nnpdf31}.

Before considering the angular distributions, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_MLL_5000_rap} we display the 
differential distribution in absolute dilepton rapidity $|\yll|$,
defined in Eqn.~(\ref{eq:dsigma-dyll}),
for a dilepton invariant mass of $\mll > 5$~TeV.
%
This is the kinematic region relevant for searches of high-mass resonances
in the dilepton channel at the LHC, e.g.~\cite{ATLAS:2019erb,Khachatryan:2016zqb}.
%
We display the absolute differential distributions with the 68\% CL PDF uncertainties
(top), the relative PDF uncertainty (center) normalized for each PDF
set to the corresponding central prediction, and the pull between the
\nnpdfr{4.0} result, taken as a reference, and other sets (bottom).
%
This pull is    defined as
    \be
\label{eq:pulldef_xsec}
{\rm Pull}_i= \frac{ \sigma^{(0)}_{2,i} -\sigma^{(0)}_{1,i} }{
  \sqrt{ \lp  \delta \sigma_{2,i}\rp^2+\lp  \delta \sigma_{1,i}\rp^2 }} \, , \qquad i=1,\ldots,n_{\rm bin} \, ,
\ee
where  $\sigma^{(0)}_{1,i}$ and $\sigma^{(0)}_{2,i}$ are the central values of the
theory prediction in the $i$-th bin of the distribution and $\delta \sigma_{1,i}$, $\delta \sigma_{2,i}$ are
the corresponding PDF uncertainties.
%
For the central \nnpdfr{4.0} prediction in the upper panel we also display the
contributions from the dominant parton subchannels, namely
$u\bar{u}+c\bar{c}$ and $d\bar{d}+s\bar{s}+b\bar{b}$.

As discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:HMDY}, the  $|y_{\ell\bar{\ell}}|$  distribution
depends  on the symmetric partonic luminosities $\mathcal{L}_{S,q}$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:lumiss_qpm}),
which in turn are driven by the total PDFs $xf^+_q$.
%
The $|y_{\ell\bar{\ell}}|$  distribution
is dominated by the $u\bar{u}$
contribution and its qualitative behaviour is found to be similar for the four PDF sets considered.
%
PDF uncertainties are the largest in \nnpdfr{4.0}, ranging between 25\% and 50\%,
and the pull between \nnpdfr{4.0} and  CT18 and MSHT20 is at most at the
$1.5\sigma$ level, and slightly larger  
with ABMP16.
%
The dependence of the $|y_{\ell\bar{\ell}}|$  distribution on the dilepton mass $\mll$
is moderate, and the same qualitative features are
obtained if $\mll$ is lowered down to the $Z$-peak region, or
raised to yet higher values.
%
Hence, for the absolute rapidity distribution there is a
reasonable agreement between all  PDF sets for all scales considered.

  $\cos\theta^*$ (left)

\label{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_MLL_zpeak}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now turn to the differential distribution in
  $\cos\theta^*$ 
  and the corresponding forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm
    fb}(\cos\theta^*)$.
We first consider the $Z$-peak region, $60~{\rm GeV} < \mll <
120$~GeV, in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_MLL_zpeak}.
%
The $\cos\theta^*$ 
distribution exhibits a small but non-negligible asymmetry,
and uncertainties are  smallest for \nnpdfr{4.0}.
%
The four PDF sets predict a similar behaviour and magnitude
of the asymmetry $A_\mathrm{fb}$.
%
PDF uncertainties in the asymmetry
are  comparable for  all PDF sets when $\cos\theta^* \approx0$,
and actually  largest for \nnpdfr{4.0} when $\cos\theta^* \approx 1$.
In all cases the predictions are compatible within $2 \sigma$,
with ABMP16 showing larger differences of up to $2.8 \sigma$ for the $\cos\theta^*$
distribution.
%
Note that the
sharp drop-off at the edges $|\cos\theta^*| \approx  1$, appearing in
all plots in this section, is a consequence of the phase-space cuts which
limit the phase-space volume.
%
Indeed, using  \lo kinematics
\begin{equation}
| \cos\theta^* | = \tanh \left| \frac{\eta_\ell - \eta_{\bar{\ell}}}{2} \right| = \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 (p_T^\ell)^2}{\mll^2}} \text{,}
\end{equation}
so $| \cos\theta^* | \approx 1$ requires a lepton pair with either
a large rapidity separation, or a very large invariant mass and small
transverse momenta. 

As expected from the antisymmetric partonic luminosities studied in
Sect.~\ref{subsec:partoniclumis}, the situation is quite different when
considering distributions with a higher dilepton invariant mass range.
%
The angular distribution and forward-backward asymmetry
in the high-mass region, for different values of the  lower cut in the dilepton
 invariant mass, namely $\mll^{\rm min}=3, 4,5$ and 6 TeV, are
 respectively
 shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_MLL_others} and Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_MLL_others_asy}.

 \label{fig:CMS_DY_14TEV_MLL_others}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Consistent with the underlying parton luminosities, the $\cos\theta^*$ distribution
 is dominated by $u\bar{u}$ scattering, while  $d\bar{d}$ provides
 a subdominant contribution.
 %
 When the lower cut  is $\mll^{(\rm min)}=3$ TeV is used, the four PDF
 sets are in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level: they all
 display a 
 positive forward-backward asymmetry, and exhibit PDF uncertainties ranging between 10\% and 15\%.
 %
 As the invariant mass cut is raised, the qualitative behaviour of the
 angular distribution and
 asymmetry change substantially for \nnpdfr{4.0}, while they remain
 approximately the same for all other PDF sets, consistent with the
 behaviour of the PDFs and luminosities discussed in
 Sect.~\ref{sec:subsec-largexPDFs}-\ref{subsec:partoniclumis}.
%
 Specifically,
 raising the cut to
 $\mll \ge 4$ TeV, for \nnpdfr{4.0}
 the backwards cross-section starts increasing, though the asymmetry remains
positive.
 %

For $\mll\ge 5$ TeV the central value of the \nnpdfr{4.0} $\cos\theta^*$
 distribution  becomes symmetric, though the  PDF uncertainty band is
 rather asymmetric. Also, PDF uncertainties
 are now the largest for \nnpdfr{4.0}, reaching up to 30\%.
 %
 Finally, for $\mll\ge 6$ TeV  the central value of 
 forward-backward asymmetry for \nnpdfr{4.0} becomes negative, with the
 PDF uncertainties increasing further so the asymmetry remains compatible
 with zero at about the 1.1~$\sigma$ level.
   %
 For all other PDF sets there is little change in the shape of the distribution as the
 dilepton invariant mass cut is increased.

\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the very large uncertainty on the \nnpdfr{4.0} result for the $\cos\theta^*$
distribution, even with
the highest value of the  $\mll^{(\rm  min)}$ cut, where \nnpdfr{4.0} finds a
symmetric distributions while all other PDF sets find an asymmetry,
the pull is always below $2 \sigma$.
%
This suggests that the more
conservative estimate of  \nnpdfr{4.0} in the extrapolation region might be
desirable, and lead to more robust predictions for the
forward-backward asymmetry in the high-mass region which is relevant
for new physics searches.
