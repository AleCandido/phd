Deep-inelastic structure functions can be evaluated with several public codes
such as \apfel~\cite{Bertone:2013vaa} and \textsc{\small
QCDNUM}~\cite{Botje:2010ay}.
%
These various available DIS codes differ in the accuracy with which structure
functions can be computed, whether they are based on the $x$-space or the
$N$-space formalism, the treatment of heavy quark mass effects and of target
mass corrections, the availability of polarised and time-like coefficient
functions, and the inclusion of QED corrections among  other considerations.

This appendix describes \yadism, a new framework for the evaluation of DIS
structure functions from the same family as the \textsc{\small
EKO}~\cite{Candido:2022tld} DGLAP evolution code.
%
The open source \yadism code can be obtained from its GitHub repository
\begin{center}
  \ghurl{NNPDF/yadism}
\end{center}  
together with an detailed documentation, tutorials, and user-friendly examples
\begin{center}
  \url{https://yadism.readthedocs.io/}
\end{center}  
One of the main advantages of \yadism is that it is integrated with the fast
interpolation grid toolbox \pineappl~\cite{Carrazza:2020gss},
and hence DIS structure functions can be treated on the same footing as
hadronic observables from the point of view of \pdf{} fitting and related
applications.
%
\pineappl provides a unique grid format, with application
programming interfaces (APIs) for different programming languages and a
user-friendly command-line interface to manage the grid files.
%
Furthermore, \yadism implements the available N$^3$LO DIS coefficient
functions, which combined with (approximate)  N$^3$LO evolution and heavy quark
matching conditions available in \eko provide theoretical
calculations required to carry out a N$^3$LO \pdf{} determination.
%
\yadism will be described in detail in an upcoming publication~\cite{yadism},
and here we summarise its main features, in particular those relevant to the
present study, and highlight benchmarking studies carried out.

\paragraph{Grid formalism.}
%
As indicated by Eq.~(\ref{eq/dis:sfs_pqcd}), in the perturbative regime DIS
structure functions are given by the factorised convolution of
process-dependent partonic scattering cross-sections and of process-independent
parton distribution functions,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq/dis:sfs_pqcd_app}
F_i(x,Q^2) = \sum_{j}\int_x^1 \frac{dz}{z}\, C_{i,j}(z,\alpha_s(Q^2))f_j\left( \frac{x}{z},Q^2\right) \equiv
C_{j; i} \otimes f_j\, ,
 \end{equation}
 where $j$ is an index that runs over all possible partonic initial states and
 $C_{i,j}$ is the process-dependent, but target-independent, coefficient
 function, given by an expansion in the QCD coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$.
 %
 In the third term of Eq.~(\ref{eq/dis:sfs_pqcd_app}) and in the following, sum
 over repeated indices is implicit.
 
As standard for fast interpolation techniques developed in the context of \pdf{}
fits~\cite{Carli:2010rw,Carrazza:2020gss,Wobisch:2011ij,Bertone:2014zva}, the
\pdf{}s can be expanded over an interpolation basis \begin{equation}
f_j(\xi) = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha(\xi) f(\xi_\alpha) \equiv p_\alpha(\xi) f_\alpha \, ,
\qquad \xi = \frac x z \, ,
\end{equation}
with $p_\alpha(x)$ some suitable polynomial basis.
%
This way the convolution in Eq.~(\ref{eq/dis:sfs_pqcd_app}) can be replaced by
a simple contraction
\begin{equation}
\label{app/dis:grid_formalism}
F_i = C_{j; i} \otimes f_j = C_{j \alpha; i} \cdot f_\alpha \, ,\qquad
C_{j \alpha; i} = C_{j; i} \otimes p_\alpha \, ,
\end{equation}
in terms of \pdf{}s evaluated at fixed grid points $\xi_\alpha$ and precomputed
coefficients $C_{j \alpha; i}$.
%
In \yadism the polynomial interpolation basis is  provided by \textsc{\small
EKO}.
%
The same grid structure can be generalised to accomodate extensions of the
basic structure function calculation in Eq.~(\ref{eq/dis:sfs_pqcd_app}) such as
heavy quark mass effects, renormalisation and factorisation scale
variations~\cite{NNPDF:2019vjt,NNPDF:2019ubu}, and target mass corrections,
among other effects.
%
Isospin modifications, required to evaluate the neutron, deuteron, or heavy
nuclear structure functions, can be accounted for either at the coefficient
function level or at the input \pdf{} level.

The grid formalism summarised schematically in
Eq.~(\ref{app/dis:grid_formalism}) requires as input the corresponding DIS
coefficient functions.
%
Table~\ref{tab/dis:coefffuncs} provides an overview of the different types and
accuracy of the DIS coefficient functions currently implemented in \yadism.
%
For each perturbative order (NLO, NLO, and N3LO) we indicate  the
neutral-current and charged-current light-to-light (``light''), light-to-heavy
(``heavy''), heavy-to-light and heavy-to-heavy (``intrinsic'') and
``asymptotic'' ($Q^2 \gg m_h^2$ limit)  coefficients functions which have been
implemented and benchmarked.
%
The NNLO heavy quark coefficient functions for CC scattering are available in
$K$-factor format and are being implemented into the \yadism grid formalism.
%
We note that the full calculation of the N3LO NC massive coefficient functions
is not available but an approximated expression can be constructed from partial
results~\cite{niccolo}.
%
Heavy quark structure functions can be evaluated in the FONLL general-mass
variable flavour number scheme (GM-VFN)~\cite{Forte:2010ta}, as well as in the
fixed-flavour number (FFN) and zero-mass variable-flavour number (ZM-VFN)
schemes.
%
We point out that the list in Table~\ref{tab/dis:coefffuncs} is going to be
updated as new features are added, and therefore the interested user is
encouraged to consult the online documentation for an up-to-date states of
available coefficient functions.

\paragraph{Scale variations.}
%
As done by other public DIS tools, \yadism also provides the option of varying
the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the calculation.
%
The code follows the definitions of scale variations
from~\cite{vanNeerven:2000uj,vanNeerven:2001pe}, which are consistent with the
broader picture of scale variations relevant for \pdf{} fits
from~\cite{NNPDF:2019ubu} where they also affect the DGLAP evolution.
%
There are two kinds of scale variations: renormalization scale $Q_R$
dependence, related to the ultraviolet renormalization scheme, and
factorization scale $Q_F$ dependence, related to the subtraction of collinear
logarithms in the adopted factorization scheme.
%
The factorization scale $Q_F$ sets  the boundary between the coefficient
functions and the DGLAP-evolved \pdf{}s.
%
Scale variations at a given perturbative order can be constructed from
combining ingredients already present at the previous perturbative order, and
hence for this reason they represent a suitable predictor of potentially
unknown missing higher orders.
%
Within \yadism, the scale variation contributions to the DIS structure
functions are stored in separate grids such that the values of the scale ratios
$\mu_F^2=Q_F^2/Q^2$ and $\mu_R^2=Q_R^2/Q^2$ can be evaluated a posteriori.

The calculation of scale variations provided by \yadism and the subsequent
determination of the \mhou theory covariance matrix has been benchmarked with
the results of~\cite{NNPDF:2019ubu}, finding good agreement.

\paragraph{Benchmarking.}
%
The DIS structure function predictions provided by \yadism have been thoroughly
benchmarked  with those from \apfel and \textsc{\small QCDNUM}.
%
Specifically, we have verified that we can reproduce the \apfel
predictions for those coefficient functions listed in
Table~\ref{tab/dis:coefffuncs} which are available in \apfel.
%
Excellent agreement is found in all cases considered, with some residual
differences well understood as will be discussed in more detail
in~\cite{yadism}.
%
To illustrate this good agreement, Fig.~\ref{fig/dis:benchmark-apfel-yadism}
displays the comparison of the \yadism predictions for DIS
structure functions at NNLO with the corresponding ones from \textsc{\small
APFEL}.
%
The same input theory settings are used in both calculations, in particular the
\pdf{}s (in this case NNPDF4.0 NNLO), strong coupling constant
($\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.118$), and GM-VFN (FONLL-C).
%
We display results for four bins of representative DIS datasets included in the
NNPDF4.0 global analysis: fixed-target neutral-current DIS on a deuteron target
from BCDMS, fixed-target charged-current DIS on a lead target from CHORUS,
collider neutral-current positron-proton DIS from HERA, and collider
charged-current electron-proton DIS from HERA.
%
A similar level of agreement is obtained for other bins of DIS datasets.
