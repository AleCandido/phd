We present a new \qcd{} evolution library for unpolarized parton
distribution functions: \eko{}.
The program solves \dglap{} equations up to next-to-next-to-leading order.
The unique feature of \eko{} is the computation of solution operators,
which are independent of the boundary condition, can be stored
and quickly applied to evolve several initial \pdfs.
The \eko{} approach combines the power of $N$-space solutions with the
flexibility of a $x$-space delivery, that allows for an easy
interface with existing codes.
The code is fully open source and written in Python, with a modular
structure in order to facilitate usage, readability and possible
extensions.
We provide a set of benchmarks with similar available tools, finding good
agreement.
