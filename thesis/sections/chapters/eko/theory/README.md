# Theory

## DGLAP intro (top-level)

-   write DGLAP equation
-   define ingredients
-   put references
-   put here splitting-functions discussion
    -   and actual equation 2.8 (define beta right after)

## Strong coupling

-   is known up to X order
-   it has to match DGLAP order
-   matching $\alpha_s$

## N-space

-   say what it is (without formulas)
-   compare to x-space codes
-   compare to Pegasus (fully N-space)
-   cite push back thanks to interpolation
    -   like FastKernel
    -   no interpolation discussion, postponed to dedicated section

## Interpolation

-   cite APPL-like grids
    -   Pegasus is failing here
-   cite FkTables
    -   eko is pluggable
-   cite interpolation basis choice

## Basis

-   flavor-basis defined
-   define + and - distributions
-   evolution basis
-   mixed basis (iev)

## Matching

## Solutions

-   LO *straightforward*
-   NLO on, "tricks"
    -   see below
