The evolution of the strong coupling $a_s(\mu^2) = \alpha_s(\mu^2)/(4\pi)$
is given by its renormalization group equation (\rge):
\begin{equation}
    \beta(a_s) = \mu^2\dv{a_s(\mu^2)}{\mu^2}{} = - \sum\limits_{n=0} \beta_n \qty[a_s(\mu^2)]^{2+n}
\end{equation}
and is currently known at 5-loop ($\beta_4$)
accuracy~\cite{Herzog:2017ohr,Luthe:2016ima,Baikov:2016tgj,Chetyrkin:2017bjc,Luthe:2017ttg}.

This is crucial for \dglap{} solution, indeed, since the strong coupling $a_s$
is a monotonic function of the scale $\mu$ in the perturbative regime, we can
actually consider a transformation of
\cref{eq:eko/dglap}
\begin{equation}
    \dv{\vb{\tilde f}}{a_s}{}(N,a_s) = - \frac{\bm{\gamma}(N,a_s)}{\beta(a_s)} \vb {\tilde f}(N, a_s)
    \label{eq:eko/dglap2}
\end{equation}
with $\bm{\gamma} = - \vb{\tilde P}$ the anomalous dimension and $\beta(a_s)$
the \qcd{} beta function, where the multiplicative convolution is reduced to an
ordinary product.
