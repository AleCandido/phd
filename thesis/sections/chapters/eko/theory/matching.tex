\eko{} can perform calculation in a fixed flavor number scheme (\ffns{}) where
the number of active or light flavors $n_f$ is constant. This means that both
the beta function $\beta^{(n_f)}(a_s)$ and the anomalous dimension
$\bm{\gamma}^{(n_f)}(a_s)$ in \cref{eq:eko/dglap2} are constant with respect to
$n_f$.
However, this approximation is likely to fail either in the high energy region
$\muF^2 \to \infty$ for a small number of active flavors, or to fail in the low
energy region $\muF^2 \to \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$ for a large number of active
flavors.

This can be overcome by using a variable flavor number scheme (\vfns{}) that
changes the number of active flavors when the scale $\muF^2$ crosses a
threshold $\mu_h^2$.
This then requires a matching procedure when changing the number of active
flavors, and for the \pdfs we find
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\mathbf{f}}^{(n_f+1)}(\mu_{F,1}^2)=&~ \tilde{\mathbf{E}}^{(n_f+1)}(\mu_{F,1}^2\leftarrow \mu_{h}^2) {\mathbf{R}^{(n_f)}} 
  \tilde{\mathbf{A}}^{(n_f)}(\mu_{h}^2) \tilde{\mathbf{E}}^{(n_f)}(\mu_{h}^2\leftarrow \mu_{F,0}^2)\nonumber\\
  &\qquad \times\tilde{\mathbf{f}}^{(n_f)}(\mu_{F,0}^2)
  \label{eq:eko/matching}
\end{align}
where the superscript refers to the number of active flavors and we split the
matching factor into two parts: the perturbative \acrfull{ome}
$\tilde{\mathbf{A}}^{(n_f)}(\mu_{h}^2)$, currently implemented at
\nnlo{}~\cite{Buza_1998}, and an algebraic rotation ${\mathbf{R}^{(n_f)}}$
acting only in the flavor space $\Fd$.

For backward evolution this matching has to be applied in the reversed order.
The inversion of the basis rotation matrices $\mathbf{R}^{(n_f)}$ is simple,
whereas this is not true for the \ome $\mathbf{\tilde A}^{(n_f)}$ especially
in case of \nnlo{} or higher order evolution.
In \eko{} we have implemented two different strategies to perform the inverse
matching: the first one is a numerical inversion, where the OMEs are inverted
exactly in Mellin space, while in the second method, called \texttt{expanded},
the matching matrices are inverted through a perturbative expansion in $a_s$,
given by:
\begin{align}
  \qty(\mathbf{\tilde A}^{(n_f)})_{exp}^{-1}(\mu_{h}^2) = \mathbf{I}
  &- a_s(\mu_{h}^2) \mathbf{\tilde A}^{(n_f),(1)} \nonumber\\
  &+ a_s^2(\mu_{h}^2) \qty[ \mathbf{\tilde A}^{(n_f),(2)} - \qty(\mathbf{\tilde A}^{(n_f),(1)})^2 ] \nonumber\\
  &+ O(a_s^3)
  \label{eq:eko/invmatchingexp}
\end{align}
with $\mathbf{I}$ the identity matrix in flavor space.
