The formal solution of \cref{eq:eko/dglap2} in terms of evolution kernel operators
$\vb {\tilde E}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \vb {\tilde E}(a_s \leftarrow a_s^0)  = \Pd \exp\qty[-\int\limits_{a_s^0}^{a_s} \frac{\bm{\gamma}(a_s')}{\beta(a_s')} \dd{a_s'} ]
    \label{eq:eko/eko}
\end{equation}
with $\Pd$ the path-ordering operator. If the anomalous dimension $\bm{\gamma}$ is
diagonal in flavor space, i.e.\ it is in the non-singlet sector, it is always
possible to find an analytical solution to \cref{eq:eko/eko}.  In the singlet
sector sector, however, this is only true at LO and to obtain a solution
beyond, we need to apply different approximations and solution strategies, on
which \eko{} offers currently eight implementations. For an actual comparison
of selected strategies, see \cref{sec:pheno:sols}.
