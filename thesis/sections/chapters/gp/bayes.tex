Exact Bayesian inference

Existing attempts: either filtering, or MCMC with a reduced number of
parameters.

Pluggable inside the rest of \nnpdf framework, n3fit paved the way for
switching engine.

Advantage against fitting replicas: one sample $\sim$ one fit

Explicit prior choice $\to$ interpretability

Hopscotch example: if someone gives me a replica, I can evaluate my prior on it.

Hyperopt Ã  la Bayes

Gaussian process sum rules

MCMC complications: thermalization and autocorrelation

\subsection{Approximate inference with \lsqfitgp}

Gaussian Process regression.

Still exact with linear transformation

Approximate for different transformations (quadratic and composite)
