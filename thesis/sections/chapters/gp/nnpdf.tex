- validating assumptions: closure tests
  - brief mention to inconsistent data
  - i.e. CT act as if finite order theory were exact, and data as well

\subsection{Generalization}

- tr/vl split
- hyperopt
- future tests
- larger error in extrap region: mention afb

\subsection{Minor improvements}

- sampling with negative values
- fast thcovmat construction
