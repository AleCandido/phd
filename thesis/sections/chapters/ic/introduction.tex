It is unclear whether heavy quarks also exist as a part of the proton
wave-function, which is determined by non-perturbative dynamics and accordingly
unknown: so-called intrinsic heavy quarks, \cite{Brodsky:1980pb}.
It has been argued for a long time that the proton could have a sizable
intrinsic component of the lightest  heavy quark, the charm quark. Innumerable
efforts to establish intrinsic charm in the proton (cf.\
\cite{Brodsky:2015fna}) have remained inconclusive.

The study conducted in this work provided evidence for intrinsic charm by
exploiting a high-precision determination of the quark-gluon content of the
nucleon, \cite{Ball:2021leu}, based on machine learning and a large
experimental dataset.
%
We disentangled the intrinsic charm component from charm-anticharm pairs
arising from high-energy radiation, \cite{Ball:2015tna}.
We established the existence of intrinsic charm at the  $3\sigma$ level, with a
momentum distribution in remarkable agreement with model predictions,
\cite{Brodsky:1980pb,Hobbs:2013bia}.

We also confirmed these findings by comparing to very recent data on $Z$-boson
production with charm jets from the LHCb experiment, \cite{LHCb:2021stx}.
