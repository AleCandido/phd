In this work, it has presented long-sought evidence for intrinsic charm quarks
in the proton.
%
These findings close a fundamental open question in the understanding of
nucleon structure that has been hotly debated by particle and nuclear
physicists for the last 40 years.
%
By carefully disentangling the perturbative component, unambiguous
evidence for intrinsic charm is obtained, which turns out to be in qualitative
agreement with the expectations from model calculations.
%
The determination of the charm \pdf, driven by indirect constraints from the 
latest high-precision \lhc data, is perfectly consistent with direct
constraints both from \emc charm production data taken forty years ago, and
with very recent $Z$+charm production data in the forward region from \lhcb.
%
Combining all data, local significance for intrinsic charm is found in the
large-$x$ region just above the $3\sigma$ level.
%
The results motivate further dedicated studies of intrinsic charm through a
wide range of nuclear, particle and astro-particle physics experiments, from
the \acrlong{hl} \lhc~\cite{Azzi:2019yne} and the fixed-target programs of
\lhcb~\cite{LHCb:2018jry} and \alice~\cite{QCDWorkingGroup:2019dyv}, to the  
\acrlong{eic}, AFTER~\cite{Hadjidakis:2018ifr}, the
\acrlong{fpf}~\cite{Anchordoqui:2021ghd}, and neutrino
telescopes~\cite{Halzen:2016thi}.
