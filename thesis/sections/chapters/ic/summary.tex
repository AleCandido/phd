In this work we have presented long-sought evidence for intrinsic charm quarks
in the proton.
%
Our findings close a fundamental open question in the understanding of nucleon
structure that has been hotly debated by particle and nuclear physicists for
the last 40 years.
%
By carefully disentangling the perturbative component, we obtain unambiguous
evidence for intrinsic charm, which turns out to be in qualitative agreement
with the expectations from model calculations.
%
Our determination of the charm \pdf, driven by indirect constraints from the 
latest high-precision \lhc data, is perfectly consistent with direct constraints
both from \emc charm production data taken forty years   ago, and with very
recent $Z$+charm production data in the forward region from \lhcb.
%
Combining all data, we find local significance for intrinsic charm in the
large-$x$ region just above the $3\sigma$ level.
%
Our results motivate further dedicated studies of intrinsic charm through a
wide range of nuclear, particle and astro-particle physics experiments, from
the \acrlong{hl} \lhc~\cite{Azzi:2019yne} and the fixed-target programs of
\lhcb~\cite{LHCb:2018jry} and \alice~\cite{QCDWorkingGroup:2019dyv}, to the  
\acrlong{eic}, AFTER~\cite{Hadjidakis:2018ifr}, the
\acrlong{fpf}~\cite{Anchordoqui:2021ghd}, and neutrino
telescopes~\cite{Halzen:2016thi}.

\subsection*{Code and data availability}

The analysis presented in this work has been carried out using two open-source
software frameworks, \nnpdfr{4.0} for the global \pdf determination and \eko for
the calculation of the 3\fns charm.
%
These codes are publicly available from \url{https://docs.nnpdf.science/} and
\url{https://eko.readthedocs.io/} respectively.
%
Both the \lhapdf grids produced in this work and the version of \eko with the
respective run cards used are made available from
\url{http://nnpdf.mi.infn.it/nnpdf4-0-charm-study/}.
