Two classes of possible prescriptions are identified:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item full space, with some zero coefficients
    \item sliced space, with factorization scale dependent normalizations
\end{enumerate}

No one of the two is strictly allowed by Eqs.\ (4.1) and (4.2) of
\cite{NNPDF:2019ubu}, since both require the usage of non-trivial
normalizations $c_i(\vec{\kappa})$, while the only normalization allowed by
Eq.\ (4.2) is a global one for the whole matrix.

Moreover, Eqs.\ (4.1) and (4.2) itself does not coincide with the correct and
general \cref{eq:shifts,eq:thcovmat}, because Eq.\ (4.2) is already defined at
the level of a subspace $V_m$ of the large space $\mathcal{V}$, and while this
are described in the following, no proof is given of the compatibility of this
subspaces as projections of the full one.

Finally, the notation used in \cite{NNPDF:2019ubu} is confusing, since Eq.\
(4.2) gives the impression that the first shift $\Delta_i$ and the second shift
$\Delta_j$ are potentially evaluated on different points, while the point has
to be always the same, simply the actual dependence of the shifts is on two
different scales.
We advocate for a more explicit and transparent syntax, at least while defining
the general landscape for prescriptions (while at the individual prescription
level a more concise syntax might even be useful, if properly introduced in
relation to the general one).
