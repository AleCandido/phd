As defined in the parton model, \pdf are essentially probability densities, and
thus they are positive semi-definite functions over their whole domain.
%
This picture is modified by the factorization scheme, required for \nlo or
higher order calculations, redefining the \pdf object, in such a way that it
can assume negative values as well, according to the specific scheme chosen.

While violating the initial intuition associated to the parton model, this is
not spoiling any desirable physical property, since \pdfs are not observables,
but their definition is bound to a factorization scheme (as much as the
factorization scale, which is an unphysical scale).
Therefore, positivity of physical observables (cross sections and related) is
preserved. 
%
Nevertheless, might be an interesting question, though academic, to check which
schemes yield positive or non-positive \pdf, and whether is possible to tell
something about well-known and widespread schemes.
