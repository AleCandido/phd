\noindent
As defined in the parton model, \acrshort{pdf} are essentially probability
densities, and thus they are positive semi-definite functions over their whole
domain.

\newacronym{nlo}{NLO}{Next-to-Leading Order}

This picture is modified by the factorization scheme, required for
\acrshort{nlo} or higher order calculations, redefining the \acrshort{pdf}
object, in such a way that it can assume negative values as well, according to
the specific scheme chosen.

While violating the initial intuition associated to the parton model, this is
not spoiling any desirable physical property, since \acrshort{pdf} are
unphysical object as defined by a factorization scheme (as much as the
factorization scale is not a physical scale).
Positivity of physical observables (cross sections and related) is preserved. 

Nevertheless, might be an interesting question, though academic, to check which
schemes yield positive or non-positive \acrshort{pdf}, and whether is possible
to tell something about well-known and widespread schemes.
