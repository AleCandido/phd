It is common lore that Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in the \msbar{}
factorization scheme  can become negative beyond leading order due to the
collinear subtraction which is needed in order to define partonic cross
sections.
We show that this is in fact not the case and next-to-leading order (NLO)
\msbar{} PDFs are actually positive in the perturbative regime.
In order to prove this, we modify the subtraction prescription, and perform the
collinear subtraction in such a way that partonic cross sections remain
positive.
This defines  a factorization scheme in which PDFs are positive.
We then show that positivity of the PDFs is preserved when transforming from
this scheme to \msbar{}, provided only the strong coupling is in the
perturbative regime, such that the NLO scheme change is smaller than the LO
term.
