\historiated{T}{he} common thread of this thesis are \acrfull{pdf} and their
ecosystem, half-way between theoretical and experimental \acrfull{hep}: being
strongly data-driven, they greatly depend on experiments precision and results
availability.
But theory is also crucial for the extraction, since \pdf{}s are determined to
best fit data with theoretical predictions.

As it is possible to infer from the thesis structure, the main subject consists
in constructing suitable predictions, in order to allow some new studies
in the \acrlong{nnpdf}, and creating a consistent and improved framework, by
designing extensible tools, that will simplify the inclusion of new physical
observables and improved theory calculations.
This will be discussed extensively in the \hyperref[part:th]{\textit{first
part}} of the thesis, and it will include a package dedicated to the solution
of \dglap equations \cref{ch:eko}, another providing \acrfull{dis} predictions
and grids \cref{ch:dis}, and the discussion of the full framework cited
\cref{ch:pine}, where the two packages are integrated in.

While this has been the main focus for a long time, when me and my
collaborators started approaching the completion of the first prototype
framework, and the integration in the main workflow of \acrshort{nnpdf}, some
new options for dedicated studies became immediately available. These
applications are collected and discussed in the
\hyperref[part:app]{\textit{second part}} of the thesis.
Most of them are connected not only to the availability of the tools we
created, but also to the many achievements and past works of \acrshort{nnpdf},
that created a unique foundation for many studies, given the flexibility of its
novel methodology and the unparalleled precision reached with its extensive
datasets, including experiments spanning multiple decades, and several
different processes, from lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron colliders and
fixed-target experiments.

Moreover, extracting \pdf{}s is deeply connected to the statistical methods
applied.
This is more or less true for any investigation based on quantitative
experimental data, but it is particularly relevant for the case of \pdf{}s
because of the functional nature of the objected extracted, that exacerbates
the dependency of the result on the methodology.
From this perspective, the \nnpdf methodology is already a novelty, since it
required a suitable extension of the usual statistical treatment, based on a
given parametrization, in order to access more complex model developed by the
Machine Learning community, where direct control of parameter space is
difficult, and not very useful.
The whole procedure has been recently innovated, even if I have not taken part
directly to this process, that finally led to the release of \nnpdfr{4.0}
\cite{NNPDF:2021njg}, I investigated some limitations of the current approach,
especially considering the perspective of the full distribution, that in the
\nnpdf methodology is only arising at the end of the whole fit, but not used in
the individual optimization steps.
This led to the proposal of a new candidate methodology, that would replace the
current usage of a \acrfull{nn} with different techniques.
Nevertheless, we currently conjecture the final result to be mostly compatible,
but at the time of writing the proposal is still at an early stage, so no full
check has yet been performed.
