\lettrine[lines=3]{\color{BrickRed}D}{uring} my doctorate, I touched with many
different topics, all related to the common theme of \acrfull{pdf}.
\dots

As it is possible to infer from the thesis structure, the main subject
consisted in providing theory predictions, in order to allow some new studies
in the \acrlong{nnpdf}, and creating a consistent and improved framework, by
designing extensible software tools, that will simplify the inclusion of new
physical observables and improved theory calculations.
This will be discussed extensively in the first part of the thesis.

While this has been the main focus for a long time, when me and my
collaborators started approaching the completion of the framework, and the
integration in the main workflow of \acrshort{nnpdf}, some new options for
dedicated studies became immediately available
